# Gulp4 Starter Project

Starter Project for using Nodejs and Gulp v4 for compiling SASS to CSS and Live-Reloading content changes

## Docker

This project uses [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) to setup all the configurations. No need to install any libs, packages or dependencies on your local machine, Docker's virtual Container will take care of that.

### Installing Docker Desktop

- MAC OSX: [Docker Desktop App](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
- Windows OS: [Docker Desktop App](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
- Linux OS: [Docker Desktop App](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)

Once you have the Docker Desktop app installed on your machine, you will be able to run this simple command

## Run Container

`docker compose up gulp`

## Stop Container and all processes

`docker compose down`
